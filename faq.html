            <p>Parking is free at the museum! There is an overflow parking lot across the street as well. If you are unable to drive home
            at the end of the night, please call a rideshare service or ride home with a friend. You are able to leave your car at the venue overnight
            as long as you come pick it up the next morning.</p>
